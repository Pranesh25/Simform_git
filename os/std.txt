hello this is stderr i/o
0 is std input
1 is std output
2 is std error

if the file is not present then the command will display that the file you 
want to read or write is not present and throw error on display 
to prevent that we use this method so as it donot display that error 
and show that error in a specified file or in the same file 
according to our need

for ex ;- 

let's say we create a file 'my.txt ' and have some content

1 . -> 2>&1 --> here 2 is std error which is sent to std output
2. 2>error.txt --> here we are sending the error to a specific file name
3 . &> is used when we simply want to sent the output whatever it is to the file
